# üßë‚Äçüè´ Teacher Rating & Feedback Ledger

## üìú Project Description

The **Teacher Rating & Feedback Ledger** is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. It allows users to rate teachers and provide feedback in a secure, immutable, and transparent manner. Each teacher has a unique rating ledger that can be created, updated, and closed by the creator.

## üéØ Project Vision

To provide a transparent and immutable platform for collecting and managing teacher ratings and feedback, ensuring fairness and accountability in educational institutions.
