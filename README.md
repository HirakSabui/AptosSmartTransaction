# üó≥Ô∏è SimpleVoting on Aptos Blockchain

## üìú Project Description

**SimpleVoting** is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. It allows users to create and participate in voting polls in a secure, trustless, and verifiable manner. Each user can vote only once per poll, and votes are tallied transparently on-chain.

## üéØ Project Vision

To build a transparent, immutable, and fair voting mechanism leveraging blockchain technology that can be adopted for small-scale or community-based decisions without the risk of manipulation or fraud.

## üöÄ Future Scope

- ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: Build a web-based frontend using React and Wallet adapters for seamless interaction.
- ‚úÖ **Poll Expiry Mechanism**: Add expiry timestamps for polls to automatically deactivate.
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Polls per Creator**: Enable support for users to host multiple simultaneous polls.
- ‚úÖ **Event Emission**: Emit events for each vote and poll creation for easier off-chain tracking.
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous Voting**: Add zero-knowledge voting support for privacy.
- ‚úÖ **Result Visibility Controls**: Allow creator to hide results until the poll ends.
